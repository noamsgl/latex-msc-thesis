Integrating the new requirements for the hebrew cover was to hard to do. So I used the BGU template.
https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/bgu-thesis-template-new-version-2022/xkvgwkkdtrpz 
As a separate OverLeaf project, and then copied the .pdf file over manually.
Thus
MScThesis__HebCover.pdf
is the final version.
