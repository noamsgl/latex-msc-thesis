        People who suffer from epilepsy undergo recurring \emph{seizures} - a pervasive synchronous neuronal firing clinically manifested as loss of consciousness or motor control. These episodes are also termed \emph{ictal} episodes. The uncertainty associated with seizure occurrences is deemed to be the leading cause of fear, stress and other comorbidities in patients with epilepsy. Therefore, a reliable method for estimating the likelihood of a near-term seizure is in the interest of epilepsy patients and their caregivers.
        
        The field of seizure timing has grown into a branch of science, attracting almost every kind of expert - engineers, physicians and data scientists, to name a few. With this expansion, I feel lucky to have examined two types of approaches to seizure forecasting thoroughly. I hope that the report of my research will make it's way to an interested readership.
